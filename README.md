## Are you a ***Pirate***?
## Do you have trouble navigating ***burning ships***?

<br>

# "First Mate" can help:
Interactive ship tile placement for pirates who want to get back to the simple things in life, `killing skellys`, `putting out fires` and `beefing up to duel for treasure`
<br>
<br>
Pick a tile from the list of options, and "First Mate" will tell you the location it believes is statistically best so that you can stay focused on plundering
```

## How to get "First Mate" to set sail with you?
1. Head over to your favorite voodoo snake lair (aka python interpreter) or start up [a free online option](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)
2. Copy the "First Mate" code from [FirstMate.py](FirstMate.py) into the interpreter and get those snakes running. Or maybe slithering..
